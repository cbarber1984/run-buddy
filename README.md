## Why I Chose This Project
I wanted an experience designing a client website to perform specific functions and follow a design scheme inherited from a design team.

## What I Learned
    - Visually sketching out the front-end elements of a project prior to writing code makes the writing process more efficient.
    - Use of `<a>` elements to implement site navigation elements
    - The difference between box-sizing: border-box and box-sizing: content-box
    - How to connect form and label HTML elements
    - The practical application of using generic classes and CSS rules to efficiently style multiple elements
    - How to use iframe to embed Google Maps

## Next Steps
    - Set the form submit button to actually submit data to a trackable location
    - Add legal disclaimer page
